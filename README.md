The AFWTls is an introductory project / approach to a CLI Golang application. Based on the `EDLS` project from EDteam's course [Go desde cero 2023](https://ed.team/cursos/go)

*  `-a`  show all files including hide files
*  `-n {int}` limit the number of records
*  `-p {string}` filter by pattern
*  `-s`    sort by file size, smallest first
